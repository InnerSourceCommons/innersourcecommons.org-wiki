## Problem

Company A wants to initiate an InnerSource initiative in order to foster collaboration across organisational boundaries. Management has selected a suitable pilot topic for the first InnerSource community and expects contributions from many business units across the organisation. Company A has nominated a new hire to head the community for 50 % of his work time, because he was not yet 100 % planned for. After 6 months, the community has received only a few contributions, most of which are from a single business unit. Company A replaces the community leader with someone who has a longer history in the company, this time for only 30 % of his time. After another 6 months, the number of contributions has picked up only  marginally. Company A is no longer convinced that InnerSource helps to achieve their goal of increased, cross divisional collaboration and abandons InnerSource. 

## Context

- Company A has no prior experience in Open Source or other, community based working models. 
- Managers in company A are not yet sold on InnerSource.
- The selected developer has little or no prior experience with the Open Source working model.
- The selected developer doe not have an extensive network within the company.

## Forces

- The more company A invests in a community, the more credible is its commitment to InnerSource.
- The easier it is to find a contact person for the community, the lower the barrier for first contributions will be.
- The more continuity there is in leadership of the community, the more likely it will be that business units in company A are willing to use and invest in the software built by the community.
- The more continuity there is in leadership of the communtiy and the faster the response time to questions and feedback wrt. the work of the community is, the more likely it will be that developers will commit themselves to working in the community.
- The less influence in selecting a community leader the community has itself, the less credible will company A's commitment to InnerSource be perceived (lack of meritocracy). 
- The less experienced a community leader is the more likely it is that he will not be able to inspire other, more experienced developers to join his community.
- For managers steeped in traditional project management methods, the value contribution of the InnerSource working model is less obvious than that of the methods they are accustomed to. 
- Managers are more likely to assign their top developers to a project if its value contribution is high and well understood.
- The more influence a community has on its own course, the more attractive it becomes for contributors. 

## Solution

Select a community leader which is experienced in the Open Source working model or similar community based working models and with has a good network within the company. Empower the community leader to dedicate 100 % of his time to community work and marketing. Such a community leader will embody the companies commitment to InnerSource.
