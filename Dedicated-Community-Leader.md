## Title

_Dedicated Community Leader_

## Problem

Company A wants to initiate an InnerSource initiative in order to foster collaboration across organisational boundaries. Management has selected a suitable pilot topic for the first InnerSource community and expects contributions from many business units across the organisation. Company A has nominated a new hire to head the community for 50 % of his work time, because he was not yet 100 % planned for. After 6 months, the community has received only a few contributions, most of which are from a single business unit. Company A replaces the community leader with someone who has a longer history in the company, this time for only 30 % of his time. After another 6 months, the number of contributions has picked up only  marginally. Company A is no longer convinced that InnerSource helps to achieve their goal of increased, cross divisional collaboration and abandons InnerSource. 

**Review Comments**
- add summary about underlying core problem present in this story at the beginning (possibly boldfaced)
- add _kicker statement_ after summary to get people interested in the contents (something like a rationale, outcome. Example: "avoid wasted effort on InnerSource"). 
- add information about initial scope of InnerSource initiative (start small)

## Context

- Company A has no prior experience in Open Source or other, community based working models. 
- Managers in company A are not yet sold on InnerSource.
- The initially selected community leader has little or no prior experience with the Open Source working model.
- The initially selected developer community leader does not have an extensive network within the company.

**Review Comments**
- clarify who actually bought in to which extent
- clarify how many resources are available to the InnerSource effort (marketing, capacity)
- add to first context bullet point: traditional companies might not have the right culture for communities to form naturally without much external stimulation and support.

## Forces

- The more company A invests in a community, the more credible is its commitment to InnerSource.
- The easier it is to find a contact person for the community, the lower the barrier for first contributions will be.
- The more continuity there is in leadership of the community, the more likely it will be that business units in company A are willing to use and invest in the software built by the community.
- The more continuity there is in leadership of the communitiy and the faster the response time to questions and feedback wrt. the work of the community is, the more likely it will be that developers will commit themselves to working in the community.
- The less influence in selecting a community leader the community has itself, the less credible will company A's commitment to InnerSource be perceived (lack of meritocracy). 
- The less experienced a community leader is the more likely it is that he will not be able to inspire other, more experienced developers to join his community.
- For managers steeped in traditional project management methods, the value contribution of the InnerSource working model is less obvious than that of the methods they are accustomed to. 
- Managers are more likely to assign their top developers to a project if its value contribution is high and well understood.
- The more influence a community has on its own course, the more attractive it becomes for contributors. 

**Review comments**
- managers won't commit experienced developers as a community leader if they are not yet sold on InnerSource and as long as there are other, important projects 
- state forces in a way that clarifies how they make the problem harder. Think constraints.
- maybe reference pattern tbd (start small, experiment then scale up as it has proven successful)
- clarify role and influence of companies cultural fit for InnerSource 

## Solution

Select a community leader which is experienced in the Open Source working model or similar community based working models, has the required soft-skills to act as a natural leader, inspire community members and has a good network within the company. Empower the community leader to dedicate 100 % of his time to community work and marketing. 

**Review comments**
- important point is that community leader is excellent networker - not necessarily already networked

## Resulting Context

A community leader with the properties described above will lend a face and embody the companies commitment to InnerSource. It will make it more likely that other associates in his network will follow his lead and contribute to InnerSource. Over time, he will be able to build up a stable core team of developers.
