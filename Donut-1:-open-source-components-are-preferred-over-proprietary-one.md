**Title:** ??  

**Statement of Problem:**  Developers tend to select open source components rather than internal proprietary ones.  
 
**Context:**  Internal component is well written and there are no quality problems with the software.  Whatever component is selected does not need to be forked.  
 
**Forces:**
There is a perception that the open source components are higher quality and more reusable.  
The channels to get any needed changes are more obvious with open source than with internal components.
Can easily grab the open source whereas inner source has less visibility and ease of availability.  

**Resolution:**  ??  

**Resulting Context:** Developers do select the best component regardless of whether it is open source or internal.
