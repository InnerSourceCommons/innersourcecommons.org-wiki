**Title:** ??  

**Statement of Problem:**  Project management believes timeline pressure and commitments on feature content does not allow for developers to spend the time needed to develop shareable code and provide support.
Context: Customer deadlines (and committed feature content) do not change.  

**Forces:**
Project management is concerned that we will miss the committed dates if its developers spend time working on other projects or on documentation so that their code is modular or are spending time supporting shared code.
Project managers worry that other organizations may require the time of their experts (dilution of expert time spent on their own projects).
Inner sourcing can generate new, innovative features and could save time: benefitting the project manager. Time in testing could also be saved by using more robust software (shared code is more likely to be more robust).  

**Resolution:**  ??  

**Resulting Context:** Time is allotted in the schedule to allow for inner sourcing.
