**Title: Common Requirements**  

**Context:** Many projects are trying to use common code.  There is a shared repository that all the projects access.  This pattern applies if there is a Strong Code Owner [pattern to be written] or if there is weak code ownership, or no Benevolent Sponsor [pattern to be written]. Someone (or some project) wrote the code in the first place and contributed it to the repository. The common code is a small percentage of the overall deliverable from any of the projects.  Each project has its own delivery schedule, set of deliverables and customers.  
Statement of Problem:  The common code in the shared repository isn’t meeting the needs of all the projects that want to use it.
