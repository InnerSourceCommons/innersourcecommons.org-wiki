## General tips
* Be specific about context; companies can differ in different ways
    - e.g., style, governance (traditional vs. modern)

## The middle management problem
* Middle management is given their own set of KPIs and objectives; their employees who are participating in inner source are, in a sense, diverting precious resources to activities that do not contribute to the middle management's KPIs. This pressure/disapproval can cause (some) employees to not engage in inner source contributions to other projects.

### Brainstormed solutions
* Explain to middle management how it benefits their BU (some inner source projects may do so directly; but this advice may not otherwise hold).
* Good developers can move to where they do have permission and support to engage in inner sourcing.
* Give the middle management company wide KPIs and goals that inner sourcing contribute to so that the MM will support inner sourcing.
* Let MM take initiatives to make this work.
* Use their evil for good.
* Make MM a mentor or coach.
* Have upper management plan for 80% capacity rather than 100%.

### How to communicate with middle management
* "It is the future of SW: inner sourcing will make your company more attractive to talent, it will be involved in something like open source, it will help retain people."
* Use concise, factual communication but include buzzwords
* Address MM fears
* Need to find the right language to talk with non-developers
* Think like a services company--invest in your people (through their inner source participation)
* "Can you afford to train them? Can you afford to train them and have them leave? Can you afford not to train them and have them stay?"
* Like with a sail boat, don't tack into the wind. Sometimes it is better to loosen your control for a while to avoid capsizing.

### Observations
* Comment: Agile has self-organizing teams (like inner source)

### Anecdote
* Completely self-organizing holocracy is possible (but has a lot of downsides)

### Thoughts for later down the road
* Eventually, what is the middle management role in inner sourcing? Inner source developers are self-organizing; do they really need much guidance from middle management?
* MM realign staff to new objectives
* What makes the company profitable? Would developers and MM know? (an argument that self-organizing may not be enough)
* Daniel Pink motivation; tell developers WHY should they do something. Extend the trust.

## How much time do developers spend in inner source?
* 10% is only effective as a teaching exercise
    - Let MM take a tour to see how it works first hand (essential if you want to make them a mentor or coach)
* 20% minimum participation
* 50% ore member

## What you use inner sourcing for
* tools and APIs, live demonstrators: inner sourcing is easier to do for innovation purposes; it is a perfect match for managing chaos.
* It is harder to ensure that SW is ready for real production release on a schedule.

## Product management
* PdM enter a contract with penalties for non-delivery
* Delivery of content on time is key
* Do you control the # of engineers? Needed to promise content on time.

## Project management
* Does project management work with inner sourcing?
* PjM ensure that the product is delivered on time.
* Can inner source work for product development? With visibility and the open collaboration model? Yes, there is a proof point from a large company.
