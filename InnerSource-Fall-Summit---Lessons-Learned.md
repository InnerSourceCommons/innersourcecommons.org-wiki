## Lessons Learned

* Use Open Source principles to increase the level of psychological safety, a key building block to pull request/inner source culture.

* Pattern development is a good way of developing solution templates for use in various companies - should give a consistent approach to most common Inner Source issues. 

* Need to spread the word on Inner Source Survey - only 11 responses! @danese mentioned that the forthcoming Github Survey on Open Source communities might be worth looking into/collaborating with.

* Inner Source can and should be a source of competitive advantage in talent recruitment (pointed out by Github folks)

## Ideas inspired by the Fall Summit

* Pattern-development library on innersourcecommons.org?

## Next steps
