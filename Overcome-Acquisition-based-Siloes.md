## Title  Overcome Acquisition-based Siloes (multiple patterns)
Pattern 1: Developer level

## Context
Acquisition(s) resulting in multiple cultural perspectives and different processes. Developer is aware and InnerSource program environment is available to them. Post-acquisition, so this won't account for code decisions that were made around acquisition.

## Problem  
Inefficient/Duplicative development across teams because they are siloed

## Forces  
- Used to different tools and reluctant to change.  
- Competing middle managers 
- Rigid timelines   
- Politics and egos    
- Bi-directional fear/Lack of trust
- Fear of losing one's job
- Fear of loss of control of domain or code 
- Fear of loss of identity
- Pandora's box/unknowns tied to opening up code


## Sketch (optional)

## Solution  
For net-new acquisition

Make the acquired teams feel secure in the new environment by
   
1. Establish a neutral (well-respected) governance committee _across both companies_ that selects from the different options across these siloes to converge and integrate.   

2. Come up with rational rules for managing code redundancy as a result of acquisition
 - Joint effort between two teams to bring new software into existing platforms. 
 - If allowable/controllable, initial software selection not tied to job security.
 - Same ground rules as above for determining tooling platforms.

3. Giving developers and middle management good on-boarding training with InnerSourcing as part of it. 
 - Clear guidance on how to bring their software onto existing platform. 

4. Make a few of them Trusted Committer so they feel included.   

5. Give them time to get comfortable with the new environment.   

6. Discoverability and visibility across the different organization.

For post-acquisition legacy silo


Make the acquired teams feel secure in the new environment by   
1. Giving them a good on-broading training with inner sourcing as part of it. To bring their software onto existing platform  
2. Make a few of them Trusted committer so they feel included.   
3. Give them time to get comfortable with the new environment.   

A neutral (well respected) governance committee that selects from the different options across these siloes to converge and integrate.    
Discoverability and visibility across the different organization.

## Resulting Context
Siloes are broken and teams working together
