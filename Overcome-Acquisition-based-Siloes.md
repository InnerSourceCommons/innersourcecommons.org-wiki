## Sketch (optional)

## Solution  
Make the acquired teams feel secure in the new environment by

2. Make a few of them Trusted committer so they feel included.   
3. Give them time to get comfortable with the new environment.   

A neutral (well respected) governance committee that selects from the different options across these siloes to converge and integrate.
