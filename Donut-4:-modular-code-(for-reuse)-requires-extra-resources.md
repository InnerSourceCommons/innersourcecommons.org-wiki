**Title:** ??  

**Statement of Problem:** Management does not want to spend the extra resources needed to develop modular components and make them available in a visible repository for others to use.  

**Context:** Assuming this is a new product/new code, not a legacy product.  

**Forces:**
Making code modular takes extra effort and time to develop.
There is a learning curve too:  learning how to write code so that it can be reused.
Extra documentation is needed too.
If you expose it, there is also the spectre of needing to provide support for it.  

**Resolution:**  ?  

**Resulting Context:** Time is spent making the shared code modular so it can be shared.
