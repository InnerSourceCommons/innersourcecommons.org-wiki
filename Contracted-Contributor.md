## Problem

Company A has started an InnerSource initiative. One of the goals for this
initiative is to foster innovation by allowing every associate to voluntarily
contribute to InnerSource projects, regardless of topic and business unit. 
After a year, only a few voluntary contributions have been received. While
engaging with potential individual contributors, the Dedicated Community Leader
(pattern link) has consistently learned that the contributors in question were
not allowed to contribute or felt that their respective line managers would
not allow them to contribute, if they asked.

As a result, the total number of contributors remained small and progress was
not as fast as expected by top level management. Furthermore, contributions
mostly originated in the same business unit the Dedicated Community Leader
belonged to.  Innovation did not happen in the expected scale. Top management
is no longer convinced that InnerSource yields the expected benefits and
abandons the initiative altogether.

## Context

- The InnerSource initiative is sponsored by top level management.
- The capacity of every associate is usually allocated to non InnerSource
  projects for 100 %.
- Cross organizational collaboration is not the norm.
- Contributions to InnerSource projects are expected to be made during working
  hours.

## Forces

- Managers of business units are held accountable for their results. Reducing
  the capacity of an associate contributing to an InnerSource project rather
  than the goals of the business unit will make it harder for them to reach or
  exceed their goals.
- The more time an associate spends on contributions to an InnerSource project
  which does not benefit his day-to-day work, the more will the workload for
  his teammates in his business unit increase.
- The individual contributor would like to particiate to enhance his
  professional network within the company and gain knowledge and experience
  with both the InnerSource method and the technical area he makes a
  contribution to.

## Solution

- Set up a governance office (pattern link?) with central funding and budgetary
  independency from business units.
- The governance office sets up formal contracting between associate and his
  line management stating the ground rules for the associate participating in
  the InnerSource project. The contracting specifies a maximum percentage of
  the associates work time in InnerSource. The contracting also makes it clear
  that business usually takes precendence over work in InnerSource and that
  it is not required to work in InnerSource for the maximum percentage
  specified.
- The governance office refunds the business unit of the contributor for the
  time he participates in the InnerSource project with central funding. 
- The governance office mediates between the associate and his line management
  in case of conflict regarding the participation in the InnerSource project.
- The dedicated community leader (pattern link) participates in or provides 
  input for the performance review of every associate contracted for more than
  20 % of his capacity.

## Resulting Context

- Allocation of corporate funds to business units for reimbursement of 
  development capacity sets a clear sign that InnerSource is deemed valuable
  by the organization and that it has executive air cover.
- A formal contracting signals that work in InnerSource is managed 
  professionally and inspires trust.
- A formal contracting provides a basis for resolving conflict related to
  participation in InnerSource activities.
- A formal contracting increases transparency and provides a better overview
  about the associate's available capacity for his business unit and
  InnerSource projects, thus reducing the risk of "over-booked/planed
  capacity".
- With a stable group of contributors, it is more likely that some of them will
  eventually achieve trusted committer status.
