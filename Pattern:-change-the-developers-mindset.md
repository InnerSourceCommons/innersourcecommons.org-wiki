## Change the developers mindset

## Context

* Top-down inner source support
* 3k population of developers
* Middle Management  is not supporting inner source
* There's already a succesfull group in the early stages
* Code visibility is product dependent

## Problem  

* Change developer mindset, it's difficult to push developers to do things.
* Developers are resisting the change, they are in their comfort zone and it's hard to go out.
* Developer organizations maturity is high, so people are used to being in some hierarchy/rules
* Developers are formed in agile, the shift from agile is difficult

## Forces  

* Manager are previous developers, so they like the way they were promoted and they want to proceed in similar ways
* Manager restrict where developers can spend time on
* Top-down approach to the inner source
* Different teams within the company have to decide to proceed with inner source
* No formal training
* Processes are not clear

## Sketch (optional)

## Solution  

* Showing reward/recognition of the developer team
* Formalize training
* Clarify more processes
* Give middle management specific objectives to make inner source succesfull
* Listen to manager complaints and fears and count on them

## Resulting Context

* Use of the several projects across the several development teams
* Collaboration within the same developer team (mentorship and so on)
