Title: The Invented Here bias or internally developed

Statement of Problem: Developers tend to select open source components rather than internally developed component.

Context: Internal component is well written and there are no quality problems with the software. Whatever component is selected does not need to be forked. The internal component was created and more complete before the open source was available.

Forces: There is a perception that the open source components are higher quality and more reusable. The channels to get any needed changes are more obvious with open source than with internal components. Can easily grab the open source whereas internally developed component has less visibility and ease of availability. (This could be separate Pattern). All things equal, they gravitate towards open source.

Resolution: Corporate requirement that inner source components should be evaluated before we go outside to search for open source component. If the open source component is now more mature, replace the inner source with the open source. Create some extrinsic rewards to trick them (initially). Make it easier to find the internal component (discoverability and visibility). Make the process simple and aligned with well know open source methods.

Resulting Context: Developers do select the best component regardless of whether it is open source or internal.
