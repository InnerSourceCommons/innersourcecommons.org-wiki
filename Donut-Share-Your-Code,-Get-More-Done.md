##Title
Share your code to get more done

## Context
Development on a specific product is siloed and a finite number of developers are involved in development activity. Development progress is not moving fast enough. Other developers could work on the product if available.

## Forces
* Development needs to go faster, costs need to stay steady
* Adding staff to get the work done using traditional methods is not possible
* Current developers are working near maximum efficiency
* Other developers are available outside the silo to work on the code

## Problem
Developers are being asked to do more work than they can accomplish. They are looking for a way to get more done but have been unable to involve people outside their silo. There is a need to drive a culture change to get developers to share their work.

## Sketch (optional)

## Solution

## Resulting Context
Development previously done in a silo is on the innersource system and people from outside the traditional silo are contributing successfully. More development is getting done per period (sprint).
