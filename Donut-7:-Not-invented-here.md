## Title

Donut: Not invented here 

## Context
Companies with software developers :) We suppose that this may also be a more common problem among deeply silo-ed engineering teams and/or in companies with more mature/entrenched engineering cultures.


## Forces

- Team egos
- Individual egos 
- The obvious benefit of what the solution could bring
- Optics challenges - teams being judged for bringing in software from outside the walls
- What metrics are being measured
- Reward system 

## Problem

Perfectly good solutions are being rejected because of NIH.
